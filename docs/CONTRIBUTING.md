Thank you for your interest in contributing to Klooigeld! Here are some guidelines to follow.

## How to Contribute

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: For any new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from `develop`.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Commit Changes**: Make regular commits with clear, descriptive messages. Follow the format:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <description>
   ```
   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes (non-functional)
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring
   - `test`: Adding tests
3. **Merge into Develop**: Once your feature is complete, merge your `feature` branch back into `develop`.

4. **Keep it Clean**: Delete the `feature` branch after merging.

## Coding Standards

- Follow Dart and JavaScript coding conventions.
- Ensure code passes linting checks before merging.

## Documentation
- Update relevant documentation files if your changes affect existing functionality.
- Add comments to complex code sections to aid readability.
